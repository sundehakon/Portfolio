                        As most developers I am quite fond of using a variety of operating systems for development of projects. 
                        At the moment I am using a MacBook Pro and Visual Studio Code for most of my projects. I have experience
                        however in the likes of both Linux and Windows.

                    <Typography>
                        I was born on the 16th of November 2007 in Oslo, Norway. I have lived in Lillestr√∏m most of my life,
                        which is a medium sized city right outside of Oslo. I started programming a few years ago, the interest
                        came from school and social media which influenced me to try it. I got into it quick, and now I do it every day 
                        for school!

                        One of my favorite ways of learning to code is just building projects. Over these last few years I have put my skills
                        to the test in creating weather applications with APIs, a webpage built for a hotel and a console based application for 
                        generating AI based images using Stability API. Head over to projects and check it out...
